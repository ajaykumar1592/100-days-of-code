Problem Description
The program sorts a list by selection sort.

Problem Solution
1. Create a function selection_sort that takes a list as argument.
2. Inside the function create a loop with a loop variable i that counts from 0 to the length of the list – 1.
3. Create a variable smallest with initial value i.
4. Create an inner loop with a loop variable j that counts from i + 1 up to the length of the list – 1.
5. Inside the inner loop, if the elements at index j is smaller than the element at index smallest, then set smallest equal to j.
6. After the inner loop finishes, swap the elements at indexes i and smallest.
